## Goals tackled

## Daily Notes
- Working on hand written digit recognizer
- thinking about some questions that shake the foundations of my current knowledge, using first principles, got fucked by taking a wrong assumption, cross entropy == squared error (such a silly mistake)
- worked on l layer sigmoid function
